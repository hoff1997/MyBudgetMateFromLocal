# Vercel Deployment Fix - Full Application

## Issue Identified
Your Vercel deployment was showing a redirect page instead of the full My Budget Mate application because the previous configuration was set up for a simple redirect due to serverless function limits.

## Fixed Configuration

### 1. Updated vercel.json
- Configured for full static build with serverless API functions
- Set proper routing for SPA (Single Page Application)
- Included all necessary API endpoints with Node.js runtime

### 2. Environment Variables Required for Vercel
Add these in your Vercel dashboard:

**Required:**
- `SUPABASE_URL` = https://nqmeepudwtwkpjomxqfz.supabase.co
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im5xbWVlcHVkd3R3a3Bqb214cWZ6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTIyMjc0NzIsImV4cCI6MjA2NzgwMzQ3Mn0.q6ezGPzDIyU7DwO2eQvRry9bfKvk3Y55-soFg9V_xl0
- `JWT_SECRET` = mybudgetmate-vercel-production-secret-2025
- `NODE_ENV` = production

### 3. Deployment Steps
1. Push the updated configuration to GitHub
2. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
3. Add the environment variables listed above
4. Trigger a new deployment

### 4. Expected Result
- Full My Budget Mate application instead of redirect page
- Complete Supabase authentication
- All envelope budgeting features functional
- Same functionality as Replit version but hosted on Vercel

## Demo Data on Vercel
New users will automatically get starter data:
- 7 envelope categories
- 21 essential envelopes with $0.00 budgets
- NZ-focused budgeting system

## Testing the Deployment
After deployment, test:
1. User registration (creates starter data automatically)
2. User login (existing users)
3. Envelope management
4. Transaction creation and approval
5. Mobile responsiveness
