# Vercel CSS Fix - border-border Class Missing

## Error Identified ✅
```
The `border-border` class does not exist. If `border-border` is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a `@layer` directive.
```

## Root Cause
The application uses `border-border` class throughout components, but the CSS variables that define the `--border` color were missing from `client/src/index.css`.

## Fix Applied ✅

### 1. Added Complete CSS Variables
Added comprehensive CSS variable definitions in `client/src/index.css`:
- All Tailwind CSS color variables including `--border`
- Both light and dark mode variants
- Sidebar-specific variables
- Chart color variables

### 2. Proper @layer Structure
- Used `@layer base` directive for proper CSS layering
- Defined `:root` for light mode variables
- Defined `.dark` for dark mode variables

## Files Using border-border Class
The following components use `border-border` and are now fixed:
- `reconciliation-main.tsx`
- `condensed-envelope-overview.tsx`
- `quick-add-form.tsx`
- `new-transaction-dialog.tsx`
- `mobile-header.tsx`
- `sidebar.tsx`

## Build Should Now Succeed ✅
With the CSS variables properly defined, the `border-border` class will resolve correctly and the Vercel build should complete successfully.

## Updated Files
- `client/src/index.css`: Added complete CSS variable definitions

Your Vercel deployment should now build without CSS errors!
