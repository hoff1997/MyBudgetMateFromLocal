## Replit-Compatible SaaS Architecture

### Core Platform (Replit Hosted)
```
Your Main App: https://envelopebudget.replit.app
├── Multi-tenant database (PostgreSQL)
├── API endpoints for all coaches
├── Authentication system
├── Core budgeting functionality
└── Basic coach management
```

### Coach Instances (Replit Subdomains)
```
Coach 1: https://sarah-coach.envelopebudget.replit.app
Coach 2: https://wellness-money.envelopebudget.replit.app
Coach 3: https://debt-freedom.envelopebudget.replit.app
```

### External Services (Required)
- **Stripe**: Payment processing and subscriptions
- **SendGrid**: Email notifications
- **Intercom/Zendesk**: Customer support
- **Google Analytics**: Usage tracking
- **Typeform**: Coach onboarding forms

## Implementation Strategy with Replit

### Phase 1: Core Platform (Replit Only)
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
**Cost**: $25-50/month (Replit fees)

```javascript
// Add to your current app
const coachRoutes = {
  '/api/coach/:coachId/clients': 'Client management',
  '/api/coach/:coachId/branding': 'Custom themes',
  '/api/coach/:coachId/billing': 'Usage tracking',
  '/api/coach/:coachId/analytics': 'Client statistics'
};
```

### Phase 2: Coach Portal (External + Replit)
**Timeline**: 3-6 weeks
**Cost**: $200-500/month (external services)

- **Coach Dashboard**: Separate Replit app for coach management
- **Payment System**: Stripe integration for coach billing
- **Support System**: Intercom for coach and client support

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Hybrid)
**Timeline**: 6-12 weeks
**Cost**: $500-2000/month (full stack)

- **Mobile Apps**: React Native (deployable from Replit)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Custom dashboard
- **Marketing Tools**: Email campaigns, referral tracking

## Pricing Model That Works on Replit

### Coach Subscription Tiers
- **Starter**: $99/month (25 clients max)
- **Professional**: $299/month (100 clients max)
- **Enterprise**: $599/month (unlimited clients)

### Revenue Sharing
- **Setup Fee**: $500-1000 per coach
- **Monthly Platform Fee**: Based on tier
- **Usage Fees**: $1-2 per active client
- **Premium Features**: Bank sync, mobile app access

## Technical Limitations Workarounds

### Custom Domains
```javascript
// Replit supports custom domains
// But limited to one per deployment
// Solution: Use subdomains
coach1.yourapp.com
coach2.yourapp.com
coach3.yourapp.com
```

### Database Scaling
```javascript
// Single PostgreSQL instance
// Solution: Proper indexing and partitioning
CREATE INDEX idx_coach_clients ON users (coach_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_coach_transactions ON transactions (user_id, coach_id);
```

### File Storage
```javascript
// Limited storage on Replit
// Solution: External storage for receipts
const uploadToCloudinary = async (file) => {
  // Upload receipts to external service
  return cloudinary.uploader.upload(file);
};
```
