# Vercel Build Fix - Toaster Import Error

## Error Identified ✅
```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@/components/ui/toaster" from "/vercel/path0/client/src/App.tsx"
```

## Root Cause
The build system can't resolve the toaster component imports during Vercel's build process. This is likely due to:
1. Path resolution issues in production build
2. Missing dependencies in build environment
3. TypeScript/Vite configuration conflicts

## Fix Applied ✅

### 1. Enhanced Build Script (`build.sh`)
- Added dependency installation step
- Enhanced error checking and verification
- Added production mode flag
- Better logging for debugging

### 2. Updated Build Configuration
- Modified `vercel.json` to use custom build script
- Ensured executable permissions on build script
- Enhanced dependency resolution

### 3. Build Verification Steps
The script now:
1. Installs all dependencies
2. Runs Vite build with production mode
3. Verifies output directory exists
4. Lists built files for confirmation

## Alternative Solutions

### Option A: Direct Vite Build (Simpler)
If custom script fails, update `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm ci && npx vite build --mode production",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
}
```

### Option B: Remove Problematic Imports (Temporary)
If toaster continues failing, temporarily disable in `client/src/App.tsx`:
```typescript
// import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";

// Comment out in JSX:
// <Toaster />
```

### Option C: Explicit Dependency Check
Verify all required packages are installed:
```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-toast
npm install class-variance-authority
npm install lucide-react
```

## Files Modified ✅
- `build.sh`: Enhanced build script with error checking
- `vercel.json`: Updated to use custom build command
- Build script permissions: Made executable

## Next Steps
1. **Push changes to GitHub**: The enhanced build script should resolve the issue
2. **Redeploy to Vercel**: The build should now complete successfully
3. **If still failing**: Check Vercel build logs for specific error details

## Deployment Commands
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: enhanced Vercel build script to resolve toaster import error"
git push origin main
```

Then redeploy on Vercel - the build should now work correctly.
